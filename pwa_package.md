## Important ‚ö†Ô∏è

Note: PWAs require a secure HTTPS connection to work correctly. Ensure your application is hosted with HTTPS; otherwise, service workers and other PWA features will not function as expected.


## Installation üì¶

To get started, install the package using Composer:

```bash
composer require erag/laravel-pwa
```

## Register the Service Provider

### For Laravel (Optional) v11.x, v12.x

Ensure the service provider is registered in your `/bootstrap/providers.php` file:

```php
use EragLaravelPwa\EragLaravelPwaServiceProvider;


return [
    // ...
    EragLaravelPwaServiceProvider::class,
];
```

### For Laravel v8.x, v9.x, v10.x

Ensure the service provider is registered in your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    EragLaravelPwa\EragLaravelPwaServiceProvider::class,
],
```

Once installed, publish the PWA configuration files using:

```bash
php artisan erag:install-pwa
```

This will create the required configuration file `config/pwa.php` and set up PWA functionality for your application.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Main Configuration File: `config/pwa.php`

This is your main configuration file where you can customize the PWA settings.

```php
return [
    'install-button' => true, // Show or hide the install button globally.

    'manifest' => [
        'name' => 'Laravel PWA',
        'short_name' => 'LPT',
        'background_color' => '#6777ef',
        'display' => 'fullscreen',
        'description' => 'A Progressive Web Application setup for Laravel projects.',
        'theme_color' => '#6777ef',
        'icons' => [
            [
                'src' => 'logo.png',
                'sizes' => '512x512',
                'type' => 'image/png',
            ],
        ],
    ],

    'debug' => env('APP_DEBUG', false), // Show or hide console.log in the browser globally.
    
    
    'livewire-app' => false,
];
```

### Customizing Manifest File

After changing `config/pwa.php` in your `manifest` array, run this command
You can update your PWA manifest file by running:

```bash
php artisan erag:update-manifest
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

To integrate PWA functionality into your layouts, use the provided Blade directives.

### 1. **Add Meta Tags**

Place the `@PwaHead` directive inside the `<head>` tag of your main layout file:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    @PwaHead <!-- Add this directive to include the PWA meta tags -->
    <title>Your App Title</title>
</head>
<body>
```

### 2. **Register Service Worker**

Just before the closing `</body>` tag in your main layout file, add:

```blade
    @RegisterServiceWorkerScript <!-- This registers the service worker -->
</body>
</html>
```
These directives will automatically generate the necessary tags and JavaScript for the PWA.


## Facade Usage üéØ

You can easily update the manifest dynamically at runtime using the provided `PWA` Facade.

```php
use EragLaravelPwa\Facades\PWA;

PWA::update([
    'name' => 'Laravel Apps',
    'short_name' => 'LA',
    'background_color' => '#6777ef',
    'display' => 'fullscreen',
    'description' => 'A Progressive Web Application setup for Laravel projects.',
    'theme_color' => '#6777ef',
    'icons' => [
        [
            'src' => 'logo.png',
            'sizes' => '512x512',
            'type' => 'image/png',
        ],
    ],
]);
```

- This will immediately update your `manifest.json` file in the public directory.
- You can call this from a controller, job, or anywhere inside your Laravel project where you need to update PWA settings dynamically.

‚úÖ Make sure `public/` folder is writable to allow manifest updates!

This command updates the `manifest.json` file located in the public directory of your Laravel project.



## Uploading a Logo via PWA üåü
To update the PWA logo dynamically, follow these steps:
Your Laravel PWA is now configured to update the logo dynamically! üöÄ

#### 1. **Create a Controller Method**

**Input Key Name:** `logo` 

Make sure the image is in PNG format, at least 512x512 pixels, and does not exceed 1024 KB in size.

```html
<input type="file" name="logo" accept=".png">
```


```php
array:2 [‚ñº // EragLaravelPwa/src/Core/PWA.php:19
  "_token" => "iKbZh21VsYZMpNd9TN12Ul5SoysQzkMXlQkhB5Ub"
  "logo" => Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile{#1426 ‚ñ∂}]
```

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use EragLaravelPwa\Core\PWA;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Routing\Controller;

class SettingsController extends Controller
{
    public function uploadLogo(Request $request)
    {
        $response = PWA::processLogo($request);

        if ($response['status']) {
            return redirect()->back()->with('success', $response['message']);
        }

        return redirect()->back()->withErrors($response['errors'] ?? ['Something went wrong.']);
    }
}
```
Once uploaded, the new logo will be available at `http://yourdomain.com/logo.png`.
